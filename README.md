# PoliMi-LaTeX-Notes
Here I keep a collection of notes I took and transcripted into LaTeX format during the years I attended the IT Engineering course at Politecnico di Milano.

Feel free to download whatever you want and contact me if you have suggestions.

## Databases

This notes are kind of incomplete. I attended Databases with Stefano Ceri as the main teacher and Daniele Braga as teaching assistant in 2017 and this was the first year I started taking notes this way.

A lot of work could be done to make this notes look prettier and better-formatted and a contribution is always welcome, so feel free to write me (at andrea3.donati@mail.polimi.it) if you want to.

## Misure

Although to this day I didn't notice the teacher (Cesare Svelto) about this, I think this notes - once finished - should be distributed to the students as they are complete with examples and solved exercises. They (will) cover the whole Misure course but they are **NOT** intended to replace neither any official book nor the lessons.
